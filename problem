In this first project of spring,
I use a class HelloWorld.java whom i instantiate using Spring Beans.
In MainApp, I have main() in which 
	create ApplicationContext through ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("Beans.xml")
	it picks Beans.xml from src folder
	by that context call getBean() with id of class that we give in Bean tag
	In property tag we also pass value to instance variable message of HelloWorld class.
	and this gives new Object
	we catch this in HelloWorld object and cast it.
	then we can use this object to call public things of HelloWorld class.
