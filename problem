In this project of spring,
I use a class Triangle.java whom i instantiate using Spring Beans.
In DrawingApp, I have main() in which 
	create BeanFactory through XmlBeanFactory("src\\spring.xml")
(XmlBeanFactory is deprecated method.
 And i have to give path of spring.xml under current folder otherwise it search for file in current folder)
 
	it picks spring.xml from src folder
	by that factory call getBean() with id of class that we give in Bean tag
	
	and this gives new Object
	we catch this in Triangle object and cast it.
	then we can use this object to call public things of Triangle class.
